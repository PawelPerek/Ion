# ION
Ion is a Dart-based HTTP framework with native multipart/form-data and WebSocket support highly influenced by Express framework. The main goal of this framework is to easy and fast make a  server without writing a lot of code.

# Todos
Its still in alpha, so there is still some work to do:
- multipart/form-data can fetch only around 50MB,
- neither the RESTful API, nor the HTTPS is yet supported
- WebSocket engine will be reconstructed
- Renderer engine will be rewritten
